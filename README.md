#RecBoot for Mac 3.0 is here!

A simple yet powerful application that allows users to put their devices into and out of Recovery Mode with a single click.

## What's been updated?

Well, you'll find a new version of MobileDevice.h is now being used.
I've also gone through my code from five years ago and have updated that.

Slowly but surely I'll continue to add functionality to RecBoot. I believe there might be ways to put devices into DFU mode via MobileDevice.h but I'm going to investigate more.

In saying that, the new MobileDevice.h file that has been included in here has a lot more potential then just putting the device into and out of recovery mode. I'm interested to see what else I can do with it.

Such as pulling data from people's phones and serving it up to a website...
